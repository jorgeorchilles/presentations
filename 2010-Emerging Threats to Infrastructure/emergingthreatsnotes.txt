Companies are putting a lot of money into security but still getting owned.
Understand the offense needs to guide the defense. If you don't understand the threats you will not be able to defend against them.
Need to put more attention on IDS than IPS. You either block it or you don't.
If you don't know something is an attack how are you going to stop it.

Damage happens with outbound traffic not inbound. Do outbound filtering also. Data exilfration is the problem. Look at all the breaches, records stolen!
Normal user = less than 30minutes and small traffic
Attack = longer than 30 minutes and lots of traffic

Move away from signature analysis. Should be a secondary measure.

Analogy: You don't buy security.
You got to Home Depot buy wood, nail gun, etc take it home and leave it there. There will be no deck.
You buy a firewall, IDS, encyrption and leave it there, you don't have security!

Saying you will never get sick is a lie. Same with saying you will never be breached
You will! Minimize the impact. Learn to get your systems back up. Incident handling procedures.

Not how many port 80 systems do you have open but what systems do those port 80 systems have contact with?
